**The war was not going well.**

At least not for House Morgeau.

[[Duke William Morgeau]] grew increasingly desperate as the front line swelled closer and closer to his manor in [[New Reikland]]. His forces exhausted and diminished, his council vain and conspiratorial.

The Duke delved into the occult for any power that would answer.

**Eventually, one did.**

<hr>

The soldiers fell where they stood, regardless of which sigil blazoned their flags. The valley was consumed by a [[Eldritch Fog|strange fog]]. The members of council Morgeau perished; decapitated, their skulls strewn across the valley. The skulls now smolder where they lay, the only motes of light in the valleyâ€™s brume.

<hr>

The legend of the cursed valley of [[New Reikland]] spread across the nearby territories. Tempting anyone foolhardy or desperate enough for a taste of whatever power the lord unleashed. 

None whom have entered the miasma have yet returned.
