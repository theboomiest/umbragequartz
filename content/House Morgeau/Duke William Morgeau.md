Head of House Morgeau, rumors concerning the mental decline of Duke William Morgeau began circulating after he moved his household to the farthest corner of his duchy, the gloomy valley of [[New Reikland]].

He claimed that his youngest son, Ducharme Renee Morgeau, appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to do just that. Duke William does not have a son named Ducharme, nor has he ever. It is believed that this is when the duke began delving into the occult in search of answers.

Several years would pass before the threat of invasion would lead Duke William to perform some unknown ritual that drowned the valley in [[Eldritch Fog]].
