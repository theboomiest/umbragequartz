Of the lineal children, there are more stories of humans coming into contact with Gerold than any other. He roams the untamed forests of the world and is friend to the lost and the isolated. He wars against the exploitation of ancient forests. Gerold has been the catalyst for several civil wars between Ryalist druidic factions and other, more expansion-minded Ryalists.
