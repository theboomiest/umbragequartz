[[Eldritch Fog]] | The fog deals constant damage, physically and mentally, to anyone in contact with it unless protected by a skull's flame.
[[The Campfire]] | The campfire clears an area of Eldritch Fog as long as it has fuel to burn. Lighting a torch using a fueled campfire consumes additional fuel but affords personal protection from the fog's effects.
[[New Reikland]] | The valley's layout changes dramatically all the time. The only features that remain in place to serve as landmarks are those that extend above the Eldritch Fog. Bizarre dungeons or features can appear and disappear even when taking the same path between two landmarks.
[[Fog Dancing]] | A cricket may partake in a ritual called fog dancing to 'respec' and rebuild their class and attributes at the lowest level of their current tier. They may only do so if they are not already at that tier's lowest level.
