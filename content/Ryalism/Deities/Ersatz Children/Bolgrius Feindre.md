Erthu removed the bones of a stallion. He encased those bones in a geode and buried them in the heart of a volcano. There Bolgrius slumbered until its birth at the volcano's eruption. The stallion's remains were used to form [[Brezaran Feindre]], making the two fraternal twins of a sort. 

Bolgrius' rage at its violent nascence never subsided. Worshippers of Bolgrius are some of the most vicious and terrifying cults throughout the kingdom.
