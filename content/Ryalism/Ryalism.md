The primary religion of [[House Morgeau]] and the [[Lumeren Kingdom]], Ryalists worship the divine Ryal family that govern all aspects of their followers' lives. Obeisance is paid to [[Erthu Ryal|Erthu]] and [[Melina Ryal|Melina]] in all things, but often one of their natural-borne children, called the lineal children, hold sway over a particular discipline and Ryalists are expected to show reverence toward that deity as well. 

Erthu and Melina have independently conceived several children through artifical methods. These deities, called the ersatz children, are not typically recognized within Ryalism and tend toward crueler or aberrant personalities. The ersatz children are often the patron deities of heretical cults throughout the kingdom.
