The youngest of the ersatz children, Edelmir was formed by Melina and Erthu from the flaws in a cut diamond and the sound of a headsman's axe.

Edelmir is the only ersatz deity that is allowed worship in Ryalism, albeit by a very specific group of people. Only jesters, those few who can speak truth without personal consequence, may worship Edelmir. Ryalist nobility fear no deity more than he.
