Originally called Valbois, this isolated valley lays in most remote reaches of house Morgeau's duchy, far from the seat of the [[Lumeren Kingdom]]. It was renamed to New Reikland after [[Duke William Morgeau]] uprooted his house in Reikland to the mountain valley, bringing along the grapes to cultivate vineyards that earned old Reikland its name[^1].
