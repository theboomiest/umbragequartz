### The war was not going well.

At least not for House Morgeau.

[[Duke William Morgeau]] grew increasingly desperate as the front line swelled closer and closer to his manor in [[New Reikland]]. His forces exhausted and diminished, his council vain and conspiratorial.

### The Duke delved into the occult for any power that would answer.

Eventually, one did.

The soldiers fell where they stood, regardless of which sigil blazoned their flags. The valley was consumed by a [[Eldritch Fog|strange fog]]. The members of council Morgeau perished; decapitated, their skulls strewn across the valley. The skulls now smolder where they lay, the only motes of light in the valleyâ€™s brume.

The legend of the cursed valley of [[New Reikland]] spread across the nearby territories. Tempting anyone foolhardy or desperate enough for a taste of whatever power the lord unleashed. 

None whom have entered the miasma have yet returned.
