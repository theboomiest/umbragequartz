Formed by Erthu out of the flesh and skin of the stallion slain to create [[Bolgrius Feindre]], he flung the remains into a great storm which seethed for 13 days and nights. The storm did not dissipate so much as absorb into the mass that became Brezaran. While lacking a face or other features that might convey emotion, a palpable sense of malice spews forth from the creature.
