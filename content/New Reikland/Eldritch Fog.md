An unnatural fog pervades [[New Reikland]]. It hides many of the features and landmarks that would otherwise be visible, consuming all but the tallest of designs. Time and distance within the fog are tenuous. Strange places appear that could not be conceived otherwise. People emerge wandering through the fog from disparate times and otherworldly places.

**The fog buries them all eventually.**

It seeks to twist body and mind to some unnatural purpose. Creatures trapped within the valley perish or warp into dangerous monstrosities. Humanoid bodies prove more resistant to the flesh-molding properties of the fog, often dying before the fog's physical work can be done, but their minds are fragile and easily broken.

**Sanity is anathema to the fog.**
