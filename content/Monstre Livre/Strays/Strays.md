Strays are humanoids who entered the fog but never found a reprieve from its torment. Instead, the fog ate away at their humanity until only the animal remained. Usually sporting eroded arms and armor hinting at the stray's past proclivities, they seek out any source of warmth or comfort in the valley and try to claim it for themselves.
