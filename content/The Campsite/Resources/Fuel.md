Flammable materials harvested or found throughout [[New Reikland]] that serve to keep a councilor's skull burning to push back the [[Eldritch Fog]].

1 Fuel can be converted into a torch, or 2 Fuel can be used to fill a lantern. Either may be lit by a skull to afford personal protection from the fog for a time.
